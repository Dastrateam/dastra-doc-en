# Roles and permissions

## General Functioning

Each user can be associated with 1 or more roles. The roles are themselves associated with a list of permissions (e.g.: write in the registry, post a request to exercise a right...). There are two ways to manage the roles associated with users.&#x20;

* If you are an owner, you can use [this account management interface](https://app.dastra.eu/general-settings/users?q=\&page=1\&size=20)
* If you have the role of entity administrator, you can manage the roles and permissions of users belonging to your entity using [this interface](https://app.dastra.eu/general-settings/roles).

## Create your own roles

To create your own roles associated with permissions, go to [this page](https://app.dastra.eu/general-settings/roles).&#x20;

You can create a custom "new role" by clicking on the "Create a new role" button\

{% hint style="info" %}
It is not possible to select both “Read/Write own elements” and permissions on all items for the same role in a module. Users can access either only their own items or all items.
{% endhint %}

Once you've created your custom role, you can assign it to any workspace user within your organization.
