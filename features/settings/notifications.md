# Notifications

## Introduction

In Dastra, there are two types of notifications:

## Notifications from the Dastra notification center

They are accessible via the bell icon ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (2).png>) at the top right of the screen and are not customizable:<br>

## Dastra notifications that you receive in your email inbox

It is possible to customize the notifications you receive from the application in your email inbox based on their category or nature.

To do this, click on your profile at the top right of the application, then select the "Notification Center" button. This will take you to the notification management page of your user profile.

{% hint style="info" %}
Notification management is personal to each user.
{% endhint %}

Once in the center, you have the option to enable or disable the notifications you receive.

The different categories of notifications available are as follows:

* Push Notifications
* Marketing
* Activities on Data Processing
* Activities on Data Subject Rights Requests
* Activities on Data Breaches
* Activities on Tasks
* Activities on Cookie Consent
* Activities on Comments
* Activities on Audits
* Activities on Audit Templates
* Activities on Analysis Reports

For each functionality, you will have the option to choose whether to keep different types of notifications enabled or not :

## For example, in the case of processing activity:

* Modification of a processing activity
* Change of status of a processing activity
* Deletion of a relationship to a processing activity

## Notifications outside the scope of the management center

In the case of questionnaires, certain types of notifications are outside the scope of the notification management center.

When you schedule a questionnaire and select "send invitations immediately," the questionnaire invitation email will be received even if you have deselected the "Questionnaires : response invitation creation" notification.

This happens because the questionnaire is e**xplicitly submitted to you**, which **does not fall within the considerations of the notification management center.**

The same type of exception applies to "invite users to complete the data processing" a feature found in your data processing records that allows you to **send a customizable invitation to a user**, asking them to **complete a specific step of the data processing record.**

This exception also applies if a user assigns a task to you or mentions you directly in a discussion (using the @ symbol).<br>
