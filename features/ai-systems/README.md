# AI Systems

## Introduction

An AI system according to the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act represents the use of personal data using software developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches of artificial intelligence. This use can generate results such as content, predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing the environments with which it interacts.

The AI Act also categorizes AI systems according to their level of potential risk, ranging from minimal-risk to high-risk systems, imposing transparency obligations and strict security and data management requirements for the most critical systems.

This definition aims to frame and regulate the development and use of artificial intelligence to ensure that it is used in a way that is safe, ethical and respects the fundamental rights of individuals.

This feature covers all the requirements of the AI Act regulations. It will enable you to draw up a list of all AI systems present within your organization. We've designed it so that every use of personal data with AI is well defined, evaluated, analyzed and documented.

You'll learn how to set up a record of AI systems and create your own repository of AI models.
