# Transparency notice

A transparency notice (or information notice) is a crucial document for informing users and stakeholders about the operation and use of AI systems. This notice aims to ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable and respect the fundamental rights of individuals.

In Dastra, you need to integrate this manual into the "Attachments" section of an AI system. You can upload it as a document, or write it directly in the tab.
