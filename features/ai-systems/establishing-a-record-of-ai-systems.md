# Establishing a record of AI systems

To set up a record of your AI systems, you have two options:

* Either you already have a registry that you can import directly into Dastra (go to the next section: [Import your AI systems](establishing-a-record-of-ai-systems.md#import-you-ai-systems))
* Or you don't have one. In this case, you'll have to create one yourself

## Import you AI Systems

If you don't already have an AI system registry, skip ahead to the next section: [Create a record of AI Systems](establishing-a-record-of-ai-systems.md#create-a-record-of-ai-systems).

You can easily upload your existing register directly into Dastra. This saves you having to fill in everything by hand.

To do this, access the list view, entitled "AI systems". In the top right-hand corner, open the drop-down menu next to the "Create a new AI system" button, then click on "Import". A new page appears, at the bottom of which you can add your existing record.

We recommend that you follow the steps on the [Import your data (Excel, Csv, JSON)](../generalites/importer-vos-donnees-excel-csv.md) page for further details.

## Create a record of AI Systems

To add an AI system, first click on "Create a new AI system". A window will appear, in which you must enter the name of the system and assign it to an organizational unit.

Once you've entered the required information, you'll be redirected to a 10-step form. This form will enable you to give as much detail as possible about the AI system.

The 10 steps of the form are:

* **General** - This section allows you to enter general information about the AI system, such as its name and description.
* **AI models** - Indicate here the AI model used to process data. If you'd like to find out more about AI models, go to the [AI Models Repository](ai-models-repository.md).
* **Stakeholders** - Indicate here who are the users in charge of implementing this AI system, and what their roles are.
* **Assets** - Add assets that support this AI system.
* **Datasets** - List the data sets linked to this system.
* **Data subject** - Contains the list of data subjects whose personal data is used by AI.
* **Risk analysis** - Define a level of risk according to the data used and the way it is processed by AI.
* **Business value** - This section enables you to determine a score reflecting the value you bring to your organization. This will enable you to prioritize projects with high added value.
