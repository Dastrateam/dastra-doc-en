# Risk analysis and business value

Dastra offers you the opportunity to carry out a risk analysis of your AI systems. In this part of the form, you can assign one of 4 risk levels to each system. These risk levels have been defined by the IA Act and are classified from minimal to unacceptable risk. We recommend that you add a description to justify the system's risk.

The next section of the form will ask you to define the added value of the AI system. Here, you have to choose between 3 levels of value, ranging from low to high. You can justify this value by describing what the system brings to your organization, such as performance gains or risk minimization.

Completing these two sections will enable you to see directly whether this use of AI represents an opportunity or a risk for you. A system with high risk and low added value may not be worth maintaining.
