# Merging elements

## What the merge tool does

Dastra's Item Merge functionality has been designed to simplify the management of duplicates and similar items in your compliance data. It enables you to combine several identical or similar items into a single one, without having to manually perform the complex task of linking them to all the associated entities.\
This feature is designed to ensure the consistency of your referential while limiting manual handling, saving you time and increasing reliability.

## On which elements can the merge tool be used?

The merge tool can be used on :

* processing activities
* Assets
* Stakeholders
* Datasets
* Data glossaries
* Measures
* Categories of data subject
* Tasks

## How do I merge elements?

Simply select the items you wish to merge :

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Capture d&#x27;écran 2025-06-13 091418.png" alt=""><figcaption><p><br></p></figcaption></figure></div>

Then click on “Choose a grouped action” and “Merge data” :

\
![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (386).png>)



This will take you to a dedicated page where you can :&#x20;

\
Select the main element to be retained after merging.

\
Select the fields of the elements to be deleted that you wish to retrieve from the main element.\

If fields do not appear on this page, the values of the fields in the retained element are automatically retained.\
\
You can then click on the “Save” button to launch the merge.

Entities (treatments, analyses, etc.) associated with deleted items will be automatically attached to the retained item, avoiding any loss or disconnection in your registry.
{% endhint %}
