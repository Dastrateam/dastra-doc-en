# Create relationships between processing activities

In Dastra you can create relationships between your processings to make them easier to manage.&#x20;

These relationships are possible between processings located in the same workspace.

## Why create relationships between processing?

Relationships between processings can be used to materialize responsibility relationships between the various entities responsible for processing. For example, in a corporate group, you can set up a relationship between a processing operation carried out by the parent company and the processing operations carried out by the subsidiaries.&#x20;

This is often the case for processing relating to the group's general administration, such as human resources management, accounting, supplier management, etc.

> A parent company X implements payroll processing on behalf of its subsidiaries Y and Z. In entity X, a "payroll management" process (P1) is created as a subcontractor. From this process, we can create a strong inheritance relationship with two other processing (C1 and C2) located in Y and Z, which will be created as data controllers. In this way, updates to P1 will be automatically relayed to C1 and C2.

## Add a relationship

To do this, go to a processing and select the "Relationships" tab located at the top of the record.

## Relationship details

### Is a child of:&#x20;

Hierarchical relationship allowing graphic visualization. No slavishness between the fields.&#x20;

The processing A is hierarchically under the processing B.

### Is parent of:&#x20;

Hierarchical relationship allowing graphic visualization. No slavishness between the fields.&#x20;

Processing A is hierarchically above processing B.&#x20;

### Is related to:

Simple logical link between 2 processes, no slavishness between the two nor control rule.&#x20;

### Has the following duplicated:

This relationship allows to keep track of the duplicated elements from this processing. A relational link is created automatically when a processing is duplicated.&#x20;

### Is copied from:

This relationship is used to keep track of the source of the duplicate processing. A relational link is created automatically when a processing is duplicated.

### Is master of:&#x20;

The fields of the original processing (A) replace the fields of the target processing (B).&#x20;

Strict linkage between processing A and processing B. The pre-existing fields of processing B are deleted when the link is set up. The fields in processing B that are slaved to processing A are not modifiable in processing B, and no new fields can be added, deleted or modified. As long as the referential elements are retained, the pre-existing fields in processing B are restored when the link is revoked.

### Is slave of:

The fields of the target processing (B) replace the fields of the original processing (A).&#x20;

Strict linkage between processing B and processing A. The pre-existing fields of A are deleted when the link is set up. Fields in A that are slaved to B are not modifiable in A, and no new fields can be added, deleted or modified. As long as the referential elements are preserved, pre-existing fields in B are restored when the link is revoked.

### Inherited from (Soft inheritance):

The target process (B) automatically inherits the fields from the original process (A).&#x20;

It's possible to add, delete or modify new fields in processing B, but cannot modify the fields inherited from processing A. Any modification in the fields of processing A is automatically reflected in the fields inherited from processing B. When the link is revoked, the fields inherited from processing A become editable again in processing B. The fields that existed in treatment B before the link was set up are kept after the link is created.

### Is tutor of (Soft inheritance):

The original processing (A) automatically passes its fields to the target processing (B).&#x20;

The target processing B automatically inherits the fields of the original processing A. The target processing B can add, delete or modify new fields, but cannot modify the fields inherited from processing A. Any changes to the fields in processing A are automatically reflected in the fields inherited from processing B. When the link is revoked, the inherited fields become editable again in processing B. The fields that existed in B before the link was created are kept after the link is created.
