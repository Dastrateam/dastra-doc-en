# Data subjects rights (DSR)

Each data subject of a data processing has rights on the data which concerns him. These rights, defined in [**articles 15 et seq. of the GDPR**](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/), apply according to the legal basis chosen to implement the processing or according to the applicable legal regime. Thus, the right to portability only applies to processings based on consent or those necessary for the performance of a contract.

For each right, you are asked to specify how it is exercised. It can be automated, for example, in the case where the person directly exercises his right within a connected environment. Otherwise it will be manual or on demand.

This section allows you to specify how the exercise of rights applies to processing. Within the framework of accountability, it is necessary to define the process for ensuring the effective exercise of the rights of individuals. As a good practice, a specific procedure can be drawn up. In this case, do not hesitate to refer to it in this section.\
