# Data subjects

[**Article 30 of the GDPR**](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-30-gdpr/) requires that a description of the categories of data subjects affected by the processing be entered in the register. The identification of the types of people concerned will allow you to analyze the sensitivity of the processing activity and better be able to assess the risk for the people concerned. Thus, a processing activity will not have the same sensitivity if it concerns minors in a hospital as a file of customers in a business.
