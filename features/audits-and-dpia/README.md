# Audits and DPIA

## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

As an organization, you need to carry out Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and ensure that your data processing operations are compliant. Dastra's audit module enables you to collect all the information you need to manage your compliance: DPIAs, subcontractor audits, compliance audits, security audits, etc.

With the Dastra Audit module, you can :

* Create audit questionnaires, including DPIAs
* Link your audits to assets, processes, actors, measures, violations, claims and risks.
* Automatically notify participants
* Respond to the audit with a simple, intuitive interface
* Track audit validation
* Evaluate risks
* Generate an action plan
