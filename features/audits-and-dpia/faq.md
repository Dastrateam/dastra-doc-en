# FAQ

## Can I do a PIA on multiple treatments?

A data protection impact assessment may relate to one processing operation or a set of similar processing operations. A single DPIA may be used to assess several processing operations that are similar in nature, scope, context, purposes and risks.&#x20;

For example:

* local authorities each implementing a similar video-surveillance system could conduct a single analysis of that system even though it is subsequently implemented by separate controllers;&#x20;
* a railway operator (single controller) could conduct a single impact assessment on the video surveillance system deployed in several stations.&#x20;

In Dastra, the default PIA model is attached to a single processing operation. It is possible to change the template so that the PIA is not attached to a process. In this case, you can make the PIA, export it and place it in the documentation of the concerned processes.
