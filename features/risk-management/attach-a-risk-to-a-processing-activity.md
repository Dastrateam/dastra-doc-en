# Attach a risk to a processing activity

## Adding a risk to a processing of data

To add a risk to a processing of data, go to the risks tab on the processing of data edit page.

and click on the "Create a risk assessment" button.

You will be taken to a risk edit page and you can start to fill in the information about the risk you have identified.&#x20;

You can then find all the risks in your register in the risk repository.

You can also attach a risk to a treatment directly from the risk management module.&#x20;

To do this, simply go to the "Risks" tab and "create a risk assessment".

## Visualising the risks of a processing

To view the risks on processings, it is necessary to go to the Dastra Risks module.

You have to go to the "Risks" tab and you will have a visualization of all the risks sorted according to the elements related to each risk.

## Risk assessment

The risk level is calculated according to the following formula :

```
Risk level = probability value X impact value
```

In the dashboard, a risk module shows the number of risks, the processings with the highest risks, the overall risk and the level of the processing with the highest risk.

The overall risk is calculated according to the following formula:

```
sum (probability* impact ) / number of risks
```

The level of the processing with the highest risk is calculated according to the following formula:

```
((impact x probability) / 25)
```
