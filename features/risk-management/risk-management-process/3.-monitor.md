# 3. Monitor

The risk treatment stage corresponds to the response to the identified risk.&#x20;

Several responses are possible:&#x20;

* _risk **reduction**:_ measures must be implemented to reduce the risk&#x20;
* _risk **acceptance**:_ the raw risk is accepted by the organization as it stands, without reduction measures&#x20;
* _risk **avoidance**:_ the risk prevents the activity in question from being carried out&#x20;
* _risk **transfer**_: the risk weighing on the organization can be transferred to another organization (via insurance, for example)&#x20;
* _risk-**taking**:_ the risk should be subject to mitigation measures, but the organization agrees not to implement them.&#x20;

This is the responsibility of the risk owner.
