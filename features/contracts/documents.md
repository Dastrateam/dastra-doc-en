# Documents

### Attachments

In the documents section, you can add relevant documents that make up your contract. This may include the contract itself, agreements, appendices, or other files associated with the contract. To benefit from document previewing, it's necessary to store .pdf files or images.

Document storage is linked to our document storage module. You can also install our cloud storage integration, which allows you to associate documents from your own OneDrive or Google Drive.

On the left, you will find the preview of the documents, and on the right, a list of all documents associated with your contract. To preview a different document, simply click on its name in the list on the right, or navigate using the left and right arrows on your keyboard (or by clicking on the on-screen arrows). The currently active document being previewed is highlighted in blue in the list of documents.

The preview window remains active regardless of the contract tab you are on, which is useful for referencing the document while filling out signatories or assets, for example.

### Metadatas

In this section, you can also modify the organizational unit associated with the contract, add tags, fill in the start and end dates of the contract, and include a description and internal reference.

The contract end date is particularly valuable for managing your contracts, as you will find in the statistics tab all contracts that have passed their deadline.
