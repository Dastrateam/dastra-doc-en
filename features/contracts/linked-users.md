# Linked users

You can associate users from your workspace with your contract to define roles such as **Accountable**, **Responsible**, or Informed.

Here's how you can define roles for your users in your contracts:

1. **Accountable**: This is the user in Dastra responsible for validating that the contract and associated elements as documented in Dastra meet the organization's expectations. This role may differ from the contract signatory.
2. **Responsible**: This user is tasked with executing actions necessary to meet the contract's requirements. This could involve implementing data security measures, managing access, or any other tasks required to ensure compliance with the contract terms.
3. **Informed**: This category includes users who need to be kept informed about the progress and status of the contract but do not have an active role in its validation or implementation. This may include members of the management team, project managers, or other stakeholders who have an interest in the successful execution of the contract.
