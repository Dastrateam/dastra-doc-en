## Setting up

DASTRA allows you to put a data subject right request widget directly on your website, that can be accessed by anyone via a simple button, as currently done on its [privacy policy](https://www.dastra.eu/en/legal/privacy-policy):&#x20;

By clicking on the "Access the online service" button, a window will appear, allowing the Internet user who wishes to make their request:

To set up such a widget, simply configure your widget using our right exercice widget editor functionality.
