# Assets

In the Assets tab, you can link specific assets to your contract. This allows you to track the physical or intangible resources involved in executing the contract, such as equipment, software, or data.

The assets you link are sourced from your [data mapping module](../cartography.md). You will find the assets associated with your contract within the contract itself, but also on the asset's profile page, where you can view all contracts it is associated with.
