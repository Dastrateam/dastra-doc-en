# Contract templates

### How to use our contract templates ?

When you [fill out a contract in Dastra](declarer-un-contrat.md), you can select the 'generate contract' option during creation to use one of our dynamic contract templates. By choosing this option, you'll have access to a list of all the templates we offer, such as the template for managing standard contractual clauses for your subcontracting agreements (DPA).

For instance, using our standard clauses template ensures compliance with GDPR obligations with your subcontractors while generating a comprehensive contract populated dynamically with information from your processing registry and repositories in just a few clicks.

Once you select the template, you'll be redirected to a form asking you to fill in the necessary information to populate the template. This form is specific to each template and depends on the fields that need to be dynamically populated within the template.

Taking the example of the DPA, you might be asked to choose the processing activity from your registry that concerns the DPA, select the subcontractor (listed in the processing record) with whom you want to establish the contract, and answer various questions about optional choices or clauses to include in the contract.

Once you have answered these questions, your contract is automatically generated and dynamically populated with all the necessary information. The completeness of your registry and repositories ensures the relevance of the information inserted into the contract template.

You then have the option to modify or format the document as presented in a preview view.

Once you are satisfied with your document, all you need to do is give your contract a title, select the generation format (.docx or .pdf), choose the storage location, and click on 'Create Contract'.

### Use Case: Generating a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) from a Processing Record

Instead of starting from your contract module, selecting the DPA template, and filling in the processing activity and subcontractor for the contract, you can directly initiate the process from the relevant processing record.

To do this, select the processing record for which you want to establish a DPA and navigate to the recipient step. Choose the recipient type as subcontractor with whom you wish to establish the DPA and click on "Generate DPA".

You will then be redirected to our contract generation with the DPA template automatically selected and configured with the processing activity and subcontractor you clicked on. The same action can be performed for a "Subcontractor" type processing record when setting up a DPA with a client (from the client tab).
