# Sign the contract

Once you have added at least one signatory to your contract ([see signers](les-signataires.md)), you can manage the signing process of your contract. It's important to note that you must save your contract in order to proceed with signing. Any pending modifications that have not been saved will lock the sign button.

You have the option to declare signatures manually or [integrate with Docusign](integration-avec-docusign.md) to handle the entire electronic signature process electronically. This integration streamlines the signing workflow and ensures compliance with electronic signature requirements.

There are several ways to access the signing menu:

1. **Declare Individual Signatures**: You can declare the signature of each signatory individually by clicking on the "Add Signature" button next to each signatory.
2. **Declare Multiple Signatures Simultaneously**: To sign multiple signatories simultaneously, click on the arrow next to the "Add Signature" button. You will be prompted to select all the signatories for whom you want to sign.
3. Signing from the Table View

You can sign a contract directly from the summary table view.

#### The "Sign" Button in the Main Actions Area

In the main actions area of your contract (see ), you will find a button related to signatures. Depending on the number of signatories listed and the number of signatures received, this button will change status:

**1) No Signatories**: Declare signatories to interact with this button.
