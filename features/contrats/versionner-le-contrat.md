# Contract versions

To track changes, updates, or even renewals of your contract, you can version your contract.

Each version is identified by an incrementally incremented revision number created automatically when a version is initiated. This revision number is visible from the summary table view of your contracts.

A contract can only have one active version at a time, which is the version displayed in the summary table view (inactive versions are not visible in the summary table view).

You can navigate through different versions of a contract using the contract version manager. You can view previous versions of your contract on-screen and activate any version at any time, including a later version.

### Version Manager

When you create a contract, we create version 1 of that contract by default, which is visible in the main contract action menu

By clicking on this button, you will acess the version manager

This menu allows you to view and manage all versions of your contract, as well as create new ones by clicking on "Create a New Version."

### Create a New Version

By clicking on "Create a New Version," you can create a new version by providing the following information:

It's important to note that when you create a new version:

* The contract name, description, organizational unit, assets, signatories, and users will be retained in the new version.
* You will be asked to specify the start and end dates of the contract for the new version (which you can modify later), and you can add a description to this new version.
* Regarding attachments in your contract, you can choose whether to transfer them to the new version by checking the box "Copy Attachments to the New Version."
* The new version is generated based on the currently displayed version when you click "Create a New Version." Therefore, it's crucial to ensure you are on the correct version from which you want to create your new version.
* The newly created version automatically becomes the active version of your contract (the version visible in the summary table view of contracts).

### To view a version

1. Navigate to the version manager.
2. Click on the three-dot menu next to the version you want to view.
3. Select "Display" from the options.

It's important to note the following:

* You can view and modify a version that is not the active version of your contract.
* Differentiate between the active version (singular), which is the reference version for your contract and marked with a green dot in the version manager, and the currently displayed version.
* Inactive versions of the contract are marked with a red dot in the contract manager.

### Making a Version Active

When you create a new version, it automatically becomes the active and currently displayed version.

You can manually make a version active by going to the version manager and clicking the "Activate" option for the desired version.

### Deletion

You can delete an inactive version of the contract at any time by clicking on "Delete" in the version's menu.

You cannot delete the active version of the contract or the currently displayed version.

It's important to note that deleting your contract from the contract module's summary table view will result in the deletion of the active version as well as all inactive versions of the contract.
