# Declare a Contract

You can declare a new contract by clicking on the "Create a Contract" button located on the main page of the Contracts module.

You can choose to start from scratch or generate a contract from one of our[ dynamic contract templates](modeles-de-contrats-dynamiques.md).

Starting from scratch, you just need to give your contract a name, upload your attachment (you can also choose to upload the attachment later once the contract is declared), and assign it to an organizational unit.
