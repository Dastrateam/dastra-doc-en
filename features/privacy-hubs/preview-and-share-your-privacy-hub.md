# Preview and share your privacy-hub

### &#x20;Preview your Privacy-hub

&#x20;You can preview your Privacy-hub at any time by clicking on the Preview button (provided your Privacy-hub is activated). If you make changes on the configuration page, you will need to refresh the preview page (or reopen it) to preview your modifications.

### Share your Privacy-hub&#x20;

Once the configuration is complete, you can share your Privacy-hub with your collaborators to start collecting responses to your questionnaires. To do this, you can directly copy the URL from the preview window or click on the "Copy link" option in the menu of a Privacy-hub (accessible from the card of a Privacy-hub on the homepage of the Privacy-hub feature).
