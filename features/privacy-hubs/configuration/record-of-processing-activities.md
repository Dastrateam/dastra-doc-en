#### Activating the 'Record of processing activities' Feature in Your Privacy hub

#### Register Display and Impact of Organizational Unit Selection

Once the feature is activated, the processing activities with a **'published'** status and belonging to the same organizational unit as your Privacy hub will be publicly accessible for consultation by all visitors to your Privacy hub.

Outside of activation, the record of processing activities does not require additional configuration to be displayed in your Privacy hub.
