#### Activating the 'Contacts' Feature in your privacy hub

To activate the 'Contacts' feature in your Privacy hub, refer to the general configuration section where you can enable or disable this option. Once activated, a new **'Contacts'** section in the sidebar of the homepage of your Privacy hub will be displayed.

#### Displaying Contacts and Impact of Organizational Unit Selection

The contacts shown in the sidebar include Data Protection Officers (DPOs), representatives within the European Union, and legal representatives entered in the organizational unit associated with your Privacy hub (see "[Set Up Organizational Units](../../../commencer/commencer/creer-et-parametrer-des-entites-et-departements.md)").&#x20;

Additionally, if applicable, the DPOs, representatives within the European Union, and legal representatives from any child organizational units of this unit will also be included.

Outside of activation, no additional configuration is required for the contacts to appear in your Privacy Hub.
