#### Activating the 'Organizational chart' Feature in your Privacy hub

&#x20;To activate the 'Organizational Chart' feature in your Privacy hub, refer to the general configuration section where you can enable or disable this option. Once activated, a new public page titled 'Organizational chart' will be added to your Privacy hub.

#### Displaying the Organizational chart and impact of organizational unit selection&#x20;

Once the feature is activated, the organizational chart of the organizational unit associated with your Privacy hub (including this unit and all its sub-units) will be displayed on the 'Organizational hart' page of your Privacy hub.

Outside of activation, no additional configuration is required for the organizational chart to be displayed in your Privacy hub.
