#### Instructions for Questionnaires&#x20;

This rich text (HTML) field lets you customize a message with formatting options and include images or videos. This message will appear on the public 'Questionnaires' page of your Privacy Hub, above the list of questionnaires available in your portal.

#### Renaming Questionnaires&#x20;

By default, the questionnaires displayed in your Privacy Hub use the same name as their original template. However, you can change the name displayed in the portal without affecting the original template name by clicking Edit Name and Description.

#### Modifying the Display Order of Questionnaires&#x20;

Once you’ve selected your questionnaires, you can reorder their display using the drag-and-drop function. The display order on your public Privacy Hub will match the order defined on this configuration page.

#### Pinning Questionnaires&#x20;

To highlight specific questionnaires, click the pin icon. Pinned questionnaires will always appear at the top of the list, regardless of their configuration order. Additionally, they will also be accessible from the homepage sidebar of your hub, as well as from the 'Questionnaires' page.
