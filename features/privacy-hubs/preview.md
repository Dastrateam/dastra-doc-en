# Preview and share your privacy hub

#### Preview Your Privacy Hub

You can preview your Privacy hub at any time by clicking the **View** button located at the top right of the configuration page (provided your Privacy hub is activated).\
If you make changes on the configuration page, you will need to refresh the preview page (or reopen it) to view your updates.

#### Share Your Privacy hub

Once the configuration is complete, you can share the URL of your Privacy hub.\
To do this, you can either directly copy the URL from the preview window or click on the **Copy Link** option from the Privacy hub menu.
