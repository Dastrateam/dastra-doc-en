# Collecting data processing projects from a Privacy hub.

We have developed questionnaire templates specifically designed to work with Privacy hubs: templates for creating processing activities, data breach incidents, assets, and contracts. These templates function the same way as our other templates, but once completed, the responses can be transformed into corresponding drafts.

#### &#x20;Add a Template

To start using these templates, go to the Questionnaires module in the Dastra application and click on Create template. Choose the Automated questionnaire option, then select Dastra template library as the source. Search for the desired template (Data processing creation, Data breach Incidents, Assets, or Contracts) and select it by clicking on it. The template will be added to your workspace, and you will be redirected to the management page of this questionnaire.

#### Template Content&#x20;

Each template includes a list of questions aimed at covering all the fields necessary for creating the corresponding items in Dastra.

#### Transform a Response into a Draft&#x20;

Once a response to this questionnaire is collected, an option will appear on the response review page to transform it into a corresponding draft (each response will be linked to the relevant field in the processing activity, incident, asset, or contract).

#### Modifying the Template&#x20;

Since each question is linked to a field in the future item to be created, modifications to the template could cause malfunctions when transforming the responses. Therefore, we recommend using the template exactly as provided in the library to ensure it functions correctly.
