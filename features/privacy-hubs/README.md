# Privacy-hubs

Privacy-hubs are a sub-feature of our module [Audits and PIA](../audits-and-dpia/) that allows you to create and customize an online space (a dedicated web page) where you can provide questionnaire templates. This online portal enables the collection of responses to shared questionnaires without the need for a Dastra user account (simply the link to your privacy-hub and an email address are sufficient to respond to a provided questionnaire). You can access the questionnaire responses generated through your Privacy-hub directly within your Dastra application.

### Accessing the feature

To access the functionality, it is necessary to have both our [Questionnaire ](../audits-and-dpia/)feature and the [Privacy-hubs](./) feature included in your subscription. You can access Privacy-hubs from the internal navigation bar within the Audits and PIA module.
