# The customer support process

Customer support is an essential element in guaranteeing customer satisfaction and maintaining a relationship of trust with our customers. At Dastra, we are committed to providing quality, fast and efficient customer support. This page describes the customer support process we have put in place to ensure optimal management of our customers' requests and problems.

## Support team availability times

Our support team is available Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm (GMT +2).

## Categorization of queries

* **Bug report :** A bug report is a description of an error or malfunction in the software or application. Bug reports require a rapid response and are treated as a priority. This enables critical problems that directly affect the use of the application to be resolved quickly.
* **Troubleshooting :** Difficulties encountered when using the software that require assistance or clarification.
* **Chat questions :** Quick questions asked via chat bot.Comment
* **Other Requests :** Any other questions or additional requests required by users to use the software.
* **Suggestions for New Features :** Suggestions for new features in the software.

## Request Prioritization

* **Bug reports :** Bug reports are considered urgent and are given priority.
* **Other Requests :** Suggestions for new features, usability issues, chat questions, and other requests are not prioritized and are handled on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Processing requests

* **Bug reports :** Bug reports are first tested by the support team. If the bug is reproduced, it is then escalated to the development team for correction. Once the patch has been deployed, technical support contacts the customer again to inform them of the deployment of the patch and to ensure that the problem has been resolved on their side.
* **Other requests :** User issues, chat questions and other requests are analyzed and handled directly by the support team.
* **Suggestions for new features:** Suggestions for new features are forwarded to the product team. The product team carefully analyzes each feature suggestion. However, as SaaS software, we can't make specific developments for every customer. Our aim is to provide improvements and features that benefit our entire user community. Suggestions are prioritized according to their overall interest in relation to the development time required to implement them, and whether there is a simple workaround to achieve the same result.

## Ticket follow-up for customers

Customers can track the status of their tickets directly from the “Support” tab in the organization settings within the Dastra application. This feature enables them to view updates on their tickets in real time, to see whether they are being processed, resolved or awaiting further action. This ensures total transparency and better management of customer expectations.

## Customer Satisfaction Survey

A satisfaction survey is sent out 7 days after a request is closed.

Dastra's customer support process is designed to be efficient and customer-centric. Our aim is to resolve problems quickly while ensuring transparent communication with our customers. By following this process, we guarantee quality support and strengthen customer satisfaction and loyalty.

What's more, thanks to our ongoing commitment to continuous improvement, we regularly analyze feedback and trends to adapt and optimize our service as well as our product. This enables us not only to meet our customers' current needs, but also to anticipate their future expectations and prevent problems before they arise.
