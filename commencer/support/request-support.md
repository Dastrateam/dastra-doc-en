# Request support

Sometimes the problem you're experiencing can't be solved through this documentation, the dastronaute assistant or online help.&#x20;

In this case, Dastra gives you the option of contacting us directly from the application, either via the "Help" button at the bottom left of the screen, or by accessing the support request questionnaire at the top right of the screen:

## Support request questionnaire

After clicking on the support button, a window appears in the application, allowing you to select the subject of your request.

Choose one of the six possible options, detail your response and click on the “Send request” button.

That's it, your support request has been sent! Our team will get back to you as soon as possible. This service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and allows us to keep a record of all requests for efficient follow-up.

## Chat&#x20;

Integrated into our website, it is designed for quick questions that don't need to be logged. Response time is around 1 hour on average, during the hours when our support team is available.

## Other requests&#x20;

If you wish to make another type of request, or if you have not yet created an account in Dastra, you can send your request directly to us at [support@dastra.eu](mailto:support@dastra.com).



This ensures that all requests are centralized and handled as part of the official support process.
