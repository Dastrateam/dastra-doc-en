# Access the partner portal

As a partner, you have access to a partner area. This area allows you to:&#x20;

* view all your customers&#x20;
* ask Dastra to add a new customer&#x20;

In addition, if you have access to your customer's organisation, you can access it directly from the partner area.

## How to access the partner portal?

To access the partner portal, you need to go to your partner organisation and then simply click on your name in the top right-hand corner and on View partner portal.
